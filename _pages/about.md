I am an Applied Data Scientist at CERN (ATLAS Collaboration) specializing in machine learning, statistical inference, and large-scale experimental data analysis.

Within one of the world’s largest scientific collaborations (3000+ researchers), I design and evaluate multivariate models for Higgs boson and rare decay searches, working with high-dimensional datasets at extreme scale.

My work combines:
- Statistical modeling
- End-to-end ML pipeline design
- Large-scale data processing
- Model validation and cross-validation strategies
- Reproducible research practices

I have experience building multivariate classifiers, designing background estimation frameworks, applying Bayesian inference and probabilistic modeling, and working with distributed data systems.

Beyond physics research, I am actively developing business-oriented data science projects focused on predictive modeling and practical ML applications.
