I am a PhD Physicist and Applied Data Scientist with 7+ years of experience in machine learning, statistical modeling, and large-scale experimental data analysis.

Currently, I work as an Applied Data Scientist within the ATLAS Collaboration at CERN, where I design and evaluate machine learning models (classification, regression, anomaly detection) on high-dimensional datasets to support Higgs boson and rare decay analyses.

My work combines:
- Statistical modeling
- End-to-end ML pipeline design
- Large-scale data processing
- Model validation and cross-validation strategies
- Reproducible research practices

I have experience building multivariate classifiers, designing background estimation frameworks, applying Bayesian inference and probabilistic modeling, and working with distributed data systems.

Beyond physics research, I am actively developing business-oriented data science projects focused on predictive modeling and practical ML applications.
